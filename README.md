# CS 250 Module Eight: Sprint Review and Retrospective

## Portfolio Artifact
This repository contains my **Sprint Review and Retrospective** from the CS 250 final project. It demonstrates how I applied Agile and Scrum practices, including sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and reflecting on what went well and what could be improved.

## Essential Questions

**1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**  
I try to understand what the user wants by asking questions and clarifying any confusion. User stories help because they break the project into small, clear tasks I can work on, making sure I build what the user actually needs.

**2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to use in the future?**  
I plan out the project, split it into smaller tasks, and tackle them step by step. I test as I go to make sure everything works. In the future, I want to use Agile methods like **sprints, daily check-ins, and retrospectives** to stay organized and improve teamwork.

**3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
Being a good team member means helping the team reach its goals, communicating clearly, and taking responsibility for my tasks. It also means supporting others and being open to feedback so the team can deliver the best work possible.
